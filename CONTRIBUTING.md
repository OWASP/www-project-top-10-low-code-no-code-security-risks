Got any ideas on how to make this project better? These guidelines will help with how to get involved:

1. Join the conversation on [email](https://groups.google.com/g/owasp-no-code-low-code) or [Slack](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C02C6RU6G10) to find collaborators or see if others have a similar interest.

See examples: [Add descriptions for business users](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-low-code-no-code-security-risks/issues/48), [Add product-specific examples](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-low-code-no-code-security-risks/issues/49).
